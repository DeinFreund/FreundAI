FreundAI
========

My first try on a zero-k/spring AI using the JavaOOInterface. 
Many hardcoded unitnames and actions. 
Partially object oriented.

This is a NetBeans project folder.
To simply test the AI you can replace the SkirmishAI.jar file in Spring/AI/Skirmish/NullOOJavaAI/0.1 by this project's compiled jar file.
